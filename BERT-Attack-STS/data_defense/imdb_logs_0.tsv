( she have truly become strong ) it was a lot better then the fillers on the series that i 'm watching now . when u watch this movie the fast action scene will surely make your heart pound . with new jutsus and garra in the movie , u know it is good . and the music was good as well , but i find it to be lacking something . but the ending theme song was a plus . ( dind dong dang ) i think was a really good song . i totally recommend it.<br /><br />all in all i give this movie a 10 , because i just love it . if u do decide to watch it , enjoy it . lol",
